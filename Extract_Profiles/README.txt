Extract Profiles Library
===========================

MATLAB code for extracting the bathymetry profiles along specified transects
departing from a given location. The bathymetry profiles are stored into
.bty file for them to be used in AcTUP.

The code has dependencies with the libraries "Grid Manipulation", "GEO FORMULAS 
(Distance & Bearing)" and "Grid Filtering".

For any code with dependencies on functions from another library, execute the
command ADDPATH(FPATH), where FPATH is the absolute path of the library.

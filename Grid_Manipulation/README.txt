Grid Manipulation Library
===========================

MATLAB code for manipulating and verifying bathymetry grids. This library
is necessary to do calculations with grids and scatter data. The "Extract
Profiles" library and the legacy files for reading bathymetry (see "Legacy (.m)"
folder in "Extract Bathymetry" library) rely on this library.

For any code with dependencies on functions from another library, execute the
command ADDPATH(FPATH), where FPATH is the absolute path of the library.

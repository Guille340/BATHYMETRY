Grid Filtering
===============

MATLAB code for designing a 2D filter and resampling gridded data (e.g. 
bathymetry).

RESAMPLEGRID has dependencies with the "Grid Manipulation" library.

For any code with dependencies on functions from another library, execute the
command ADDPATH(FPATH), where FPATH is the absolute path of the library.
